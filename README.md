# House-Price-Prediction-and-Outlier-Detection

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques and detecting outliers in a housing dataset. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection using both manual and algorithmic approaches, and the comparison of different data imputation methods. Additionally, it includes the development and evaluation of multiple regression models for predicting housing prices based on various features.

## Key Features
- Manual and algorithmic outlier detection
- Data imputation using KNN and MICE methods
- Regression modeling for housing price prediction
- Comparison of machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning
- Detailed analysis with visualizations and performance metrics

## Languages & Tools
